# Swift-JSON-Mappers
This is a collection of resources of different frameworks and libraries used to map (decode-encode-serialize) JSON's in Swift. I'm coping all descriptions from their original source.

## Unbox

Unbox is an easy to use Swift JSON decoder. Don't spend hours writing JSON decoding code - just unbox it instead!
Is lightweight, non-magical and doesn't require you to subclass, make your JSON conform to a specific schema or completely change the way you write model code. It can be used on any model with ease.

And a extension to use unbox with Alamo Fire

## Object Mapper


ObjectMapper is a framework written in Swift that makes it easy for you to convert your model objects (classes and structs) to and from JSON.

## Mapper

Mapper is a simple Swift library to convert JSON to strongly typed objects. One advantage to Mapper over some other libraries is you can have immutable properties

## SwiftyJSON

Perhaps the most used parser for Swift, and it's a little more verbose than the above ones.

## Marshal

They say that this library will help you write declarative, performant, error handled code using the power of Protocol Oriented Programmingâ„¢. I believe them.

## Genome

This library looks promising, uses Node on top of ... it?

Genome is built on top of Node as opposed to JSON directly. This makes it easy for Genome to work with any data type through little effort.

All mapping operations are built as sugar on top of Node's core.
